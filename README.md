# make your plots fancy
I'm sick and tired of plots that aren't fancy! `barFancy` and `scatterFancy` make your bar and scatter plots beautiful (even when your data aren't). They have the following features that are difficult to implement in Matlab:

`barFancy`
* handles grouped bars with **arbitrarily complex factor hierarchies** (multiple factors, each having multiple levels)
* make "violin plots" that show vertical probability density estimates
* tons of display options (see below)

`scatterFancy`
* can add marginal probability density estimates for x and y data
